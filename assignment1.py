# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
# integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

# In[2]:


# * :- Mathematial operator for mjultiplication
# 'hello' :- String
# -87.8 :- Float
# - :- mathemaitical operator for subtraction
# / :- mathematical operator for division
# + :- mathematical operator for addition
# 6 :- Integer


# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?

# In[4]:


# String is a collection of alpha-numeric characters which is stored in a variable
# Variable is a name given to the memory location which stores the values


# 3. Describe three different data types.

# In[6]:


#Integers – It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal).
#Float – It is a real number with floating point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.
#String – A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote.


# 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

# In[8]:


#An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.


# 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
# expression and a statement?

# In[10]:


#Statements represent an action or command e.g print statements, assignment statements. 
#Expression is a combination of variables, operations and values that yields a result value.
#here , spam =10 means spam is a variable which has a variable 10, this is assignment statement
# when coming to expression it checks whether the spam is equal to 10.


# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
# bacon = 22
# bacon + 1

# In[13]:


bacon=22


# In[15]:

# &#39;spam&#39; + &#39;spamspam&#39;
# &#39;spam&#39; * 3

# In[18]:


'spam' + 'spamspam'


# In[20]:


'spam' * 3


# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

# In[21]:


#Because, Variable names cannot begin with a number.


# 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
# version of a value?

# In[22]:


# int() , float() , and str( )


# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
# &#39;I have eaten &#39; + 99 + &#39; burritos.&#39;

# In[24]:
